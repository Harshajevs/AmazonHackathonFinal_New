## Prototype Documentation

This repository contains the following components:

- **FireTV(UI)_Website:**  
  A website demonstrating the user interface and showcasing the envisioned look and feel of Fire TV after our developments.

- **Statement 1:**  
  Personalized AI-driven content recommendation engine for Fire TV that considers mood, past behavior, and time of day.

- **Statement 2:**  
  Innovative social features for shared viewing experiences.

- **Statement 3:**  
  Social watching capabilities across OTT platforms.

## Project Overview

We have developed a website located inside the `FireTV(UI)_Website` folder. This website serves as a visual showcase of the Fire TV user interface post-development.  
**Note:** The website is not yet integrated with the backend implementations.

Full integration requires additional components such as:
- Voice detection (Alexa)
- Webcam access for face analysis
- User interaction behavior tracking
- History analysis

These components are currently simulated through Python codes and models that demonstrate our solution's functionality.

Before running any code, please carefully review the accompanying documentation file (`[placeholder for documentation]`) to understand the implementation details.

By exploring the website, you will gain a foundational understanding of our implementation approach.

## How to Run

### Website

1. Navigate to the `FireTV(UI)_Website` directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

### Machine Learning Codes (Voice, Face, VR Filters, Background Removal)

These codes are recommended to be run in Google Colab, as demonstrated in our project.

### Python Codes

- Navigate to the respective folders and execute the Python scripts as needed.
- For `Statement-2/Custom_Room_Simulator`, please refer to the `try_codes.txt` file for terminal commands and instructions.

For detailed implementation guidance, please consult the documentation file (`[placeholder for documentation]`).
